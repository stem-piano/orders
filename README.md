# Ordering Information

Each subdirectory is specific to one order.

Subdirectories contain some or all of the following.

* Gerber files (or links: see below).
* Parts files (or links: see below).
* Parts information (or links: see below).
* Placement files (or links: see below).
* Any other technical information required to complete an order.
* Links to, or information about, where files were copied from in repository (if copied).

Each of above is in manufacturer required format. This format could be slightly different than how the information is formatted in a stem piano repository.

Although some of this information may be duplicates, having everything in one location simplifies pre-order reviews and re-ordering.

A link is ok in place of a file, if the link is to the exact stem piano file commit/version used for order.
