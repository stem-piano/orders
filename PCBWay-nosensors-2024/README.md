# Gerber files

These are exactly the same as current (at time of writing) Gerber files in the [DIY-Grand-Digital-Piano](https://github.com/gzweigle/DIY-Grand-Digital-Piano/tree/main/hardware/releases/)

However I am including them here because the vendor wants them zipped (and hence it's a small change compared to what it's there) and because they will
likely change on the main repo as new things are introduced (I guess the second one can be solved with the permalinks I am providing below anyway, but
since the files are small I see the convenience of collecting everything like it has been ordered)
